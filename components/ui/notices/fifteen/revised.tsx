              Missouri law requires Assessors to complete a physical inspection
              of any residential property that increases by more than 15% due to
              reassessment (excluding new construction). Such physical
              inspection includes an on-site personal observation and review of
              all exterior portions of the land and buildings and improvements
              to which the inspector has or may reasonably and lawfully gain
              external access. As part of the physical inspection process, you
              are hereby notified of your right for an interior inspection of
              your property. An interior inspection will only be performed if
              specifically requested by the taxpayer. If you do not want us to
              enter your property due to health or other concerns, you can
              submit pictures and other information about the condition of your
              home by emailing zasr@stlouis-mo.gov .
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Please make sure you include your parcel number and address in
              your email. All requests for an interior inspection should be made
              prior to June 10th.

              This will in no way affect your ability to appeal after you
              receive your Change of Assessment notice in May 2025. State law
              requires the Assessor to revalue all real property in the City as
              of January 1st of every odd-numbered year.
